## 🚀 Acquisition Channels (Ranked by Speed)

### 1. Direct Outreach (Fastest)
**Expected: 8-12 clients**

**Strategy:**
- Find companies with outdated websites using tools like:
  - BuiltWith (tech stack detection)
  - Wappalyzer (browser extension)
  - Manual Google searches: "industry + regio + website"
- Send personalized cold emails highlighting ONE specific issue
- Follow up on LinkedIn

**Template:**
```
Subject: [Company] website — quick observation

Hi [Name],

I was looking at [Company] and noticed [specific issue: slow load time / outdated design / mobile issues / broken contact form].

We specialize in fixing exactly this — usually within 2-3 weeks for €2-3K.

Would it help if I showed you a quick mockup of what an improved version could look like?

— Sem, Vibecoders
```

**Volume needed:**
- 200-300 emails sent
- 20-30 replies (10%)
- 10-15 calls booked
- 8-12 deals closed (at your quality level)

### 2. Referral Program (Highest Quality)
**Expected: 5-8 clients**

**Strategy:**
- Contact ALL past clients
- Offer €250-500 referral bonus per closed deal
- Make it dead simple: "Know anyone who needs a website upgrade?"

**Script:**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick question: do you know any business owners who've complained about their website recently?

If you introduce us and they become a client, I'll send you €300 as a thank you.

No pressure — just thought I'd ask since you know my work.

— Sem
```

**Why it works:**
- Trust is pre-built
- Higher close rate (30-50%)
- Better clients (similar to existing ones)

### 3. LinkedIn Content + DMs (Medium Term)
**Expected: 5-10 clients**

**Strategy:**
- Post 3x/week about:
  - Website fails you've seen
  - Quick wins for SMBs
  - Before/after transformations
  - Client results (anonymized or with permission)
- When someone engages, DM them
- Use Foreseen LinkedIn generator!

**DM Template:**
```
Hey [Name], saw you liked my post about [topic].

Quick question: is your company currently happy with how your website converts visitors to leads?

Just curious — no pitch, just talking shop.
```

**Volume:**
- 15-20 posts/month
- 50-100 DM conversations
- 10-20 calls
- 5-10 clients

### 4. Local Business Networking
**Expected: 3-5 clients**

**Strategy:**
- Join local business clubs (ondernemersclub, BNI, etc.)
- Attend 2-3 events per month
- Give a free "website audit" to members
- Word of mouth spreads fast in these circles

**Pitch:**
```
"I help SMBs fix their websites in 2-3 weeks for under €3K. 
Most businesses are leaving money on the table because their 
site doesn't convert. Happy to do a free 15-minute audit for 
anyone interested."
```

### 5. Partner Agencies
**Expected: 3-5 clients**

**Strategy:**
- Find marketing agencies that don't do development
- Offer to be their "dev partner" for a 15-20% referral fee
- They get to offer more services, you get warm leads

**Who to contact:**
- Social media agencies
- SEO agencies
- Branding agencies
- Marketing consultants
